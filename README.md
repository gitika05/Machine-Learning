Assignment 5: Water Treatment Plant

Water Treatment Plant Clustering

After analysing the dataset it was found that records of four stages of water treatment have been kept, they being

1. Entry to plant

2. Moving to primary settler

3. Moving to secondary settler

4. Moving out of the treatment plant

The dataframe was divided into above four sub datasets, for cluster formations.

Different dataframes have been made as, according to our opinion, each dataframe acts as target of previous.

While calculating the Silhouette score, we found scores to be in range of 0.1 to 0.3, and hence no clear clusters were formed based on K-means method.
